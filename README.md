# Action-Actor-Mullti-label-Classification

The main aim is to identify all the actors (adult, dog, bird, baby etc) performing certain actions (Jumping, rolling, walking,etc) from a frame of the video or by using nearby frames. We have used multiple architectures which have tried to improve on the existing baseline model. You can find more information on our approach here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00141
